# accelerated-cpp
Exercises from the book "Accelerated C++" by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo.

~~Still a work in progress.~~ As of now this is abandoned. The book is a pleasure to go through, but at the time it was written there were no such things as C++11 nor C++14. For this reason I gave up on this and started [Stroustrup's PPP 2nd edition](http://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html), which uses and emphasizes features from more modern C++.

All the code compiles warning-free using `g++ -Wall -std=c++11` on Debian 8.6, gcc version 4.9.2.
